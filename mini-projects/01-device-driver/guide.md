- 2 points: Used interrupts for button and led states and then used that for transmission
- 2 points: Computation is done on the controller themselves instead of the computer
- 3 points: Added a GUI to run our game
- 3 points: Added visualizations of the players' position over time and then the difference between their distances over time to see their performance throughout the game
